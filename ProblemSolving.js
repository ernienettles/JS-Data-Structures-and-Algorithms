// If you don't know something right off the bat, how do you solve it?

// How do you improve?
// 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// PROBLEM SOLVING

// Step 1 - Understand the Problem
    // Steps:
        // 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
        // 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        // 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
        // 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information
        // to solve the problem? This may not be anwerable until you set about solving the problem.
        // 5. How should I lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// Step 2 - Explore Concrete Examples
    // Example:
        // Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
            charCount("aaaa") // {a:4}
            charCount("hello") // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:}

    // Then explore more complex examples:
        charCount("my phone number is 1827634") // Do I want to consider numbers and special characters?
        charCount("Hello hi") // Do I store both the uppercase and lowercase H?
        charCount(null) // What do I do with other data types?

// Step 3 - Break it Down
    // Explicitly write out the steps you need to take using comments.
        // This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any
        // lingering cenceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details
        // (e.g. language syntax) as well.

// Step 4 - Solve/Simplify
    // If you can't solve a harder part of the problem:
        // Solve a simpler problem
            // This tends to look better to an interviewer than getting completely stuck on the harder part, and
            // can often lead to a better understanding of it.
    // Steps:
        // 1. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
        // 2. Temporarilty ignore that difficulty
        // 3. Write a simplified solution
        // 4. Incorporate that difficulty back in


// Step 5 - Look Back and Refactor
    // Improve your code after you have a working solution
        // Look back on the code and figure out what you don't like about it.
        // A balance needs to be struck between efficiency, readability, and how easy the code is to understand.
    // Questions to ask:
        // 1. Can you check the result?
        // 2. Can you derive the result differently?
        // 3. Can you understand it at a glance?
        // 4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
        // 5. Can you improve the performance of the solution?
        // 6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
        // 7. How have other people solved this problem?
